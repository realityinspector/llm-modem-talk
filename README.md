# Initial Test Findings 

Using https://x.com/adriandittmann/status/1810049149267755294?t=fSt_wwM-4rFgDOJGjczTAQ 

I got this transcription: 

roughly aligns to Hume voice:

"moved in but is your job with you button your mind i'm all ears and you wouldn't talk about money than interesting work son or we could guide and you found a big if you prefer that sounds good to you" 

The Weird Modem Section:

"ths ca tag her and our wow nash hoodlum newly at all out kong whole abode"

Hume:

"wound was i mean" [sic "what was that"?]

Not Modem Voice:
"i'm thinkin' was this sound i'm not sure what it was the most of which there for a second let's start over"
